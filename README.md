# Unemployment Analysis

This project is the part of my **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship -  Project 2**, delves into Unemployment Analysis utilizing Python using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Focused on the challenging context of the COVID-19 period in India, the project employs statistical tools and visualizations to scrutinize unemployment trends. Through comprehensive data exploration and interpretation, it aims to uncover insights into the impact of the pandemic on employment dynamics in the Indian context, contributing valuable perspectives for informed decision-making.
